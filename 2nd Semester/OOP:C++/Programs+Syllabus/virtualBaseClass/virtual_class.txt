if class a is base and class b and class c is child class 
which is inheriting class a and there is class d which is 
inheriting class b and c , here data members and function 
of class a is copied in both class b and c and again data 
members and function of class a and class b both is copied 
in class d . this will cause ambiguity and to remove this
problem we use virtual base class.
Yes, that is correct. When multiple classes inherit from 
a common base class, the base class members are replicated
in all the child classes, leading to ambiguity. 
Virtual base classes allow for the removal of this ambiguity 
by ensuring that the members of the base class are only 
inherited once, even if multiple child classes inherit
from it. This helps to avoid data duplication and provides
a cleaner inheritance hierarchy.
