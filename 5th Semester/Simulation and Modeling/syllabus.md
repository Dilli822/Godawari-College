Laboratory Works:
After completing this course, students should have practical knowledge regarding simulation of some real time systems (continuous and discrete event systems), Queuing Systems, Random Number generations as well as study of Simulation Tools and Language. Verification and validation of models can be done, the analysis of outputs produced in the laboratory exercise can also be performed. The laboratory work should include:  Implement different methods of random number generation  Simulating games of dice that generate discrete random variate, using random number generation  Testing of random numbers (K-S and Chi Square Test)  Implementing applications of Monte Carlo methods  Implement applications of Markov’s chain  Simulation of single queue server system  GPSS models - queue, storage, facility, multi-server queue, decision making problems
